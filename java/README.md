# Youtube Challenge - Java
The Java Youtube Challenge uses Java 11. 

## Setting up
You can write code in any editor you'd like. However, different editors have 
different ways of dealing with Java code, so in case of doubt we recommend 
you run the code and tests from the command line as shown  below.

The below commands assume you are located in the java/ folder.

## Running the Command line application
```shell script
javac src/Run.java
java src.Run
```

## Running the tests
To run all the tests:
```shell script
python3 -m pytest
```
