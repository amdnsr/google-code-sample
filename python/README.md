# Youtube Challenge - Python
The Python Youtube Challenge uses Python3. The below commands use Python3 specifically, to account for users that might have Python2 installed alongside Python3.

## Running the Command line application

python3 src/run.py
```

The tests are using pytest, if you don't have pytest installed yet, you can do so by running:
```py
python3 -m pip install pytest
```

```

To run them individually per part:
```py
